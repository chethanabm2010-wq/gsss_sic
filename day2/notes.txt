ARITHMETIC OPERATORS

+ - * / % ^ // ==


All the arithmetic operators except the power operator have  Left to Right Associativity
operator precedence where + and - have least precedence




note:in a particular case 11111111 is not 255 when is it?  (*big endian and small endian concept)
so in signed byte the max value and min value are :
01111111= 127           
10000000=-128

5+6 can be calculated/solved  in binary -> 0101+0110=1011
but we cannot solve 5+6.055 (bcoz 6.05 cannot be converted to binary)using binary but here we convert int to float and solve 
--->>  we cannot perform operations which has diff data types.


relational operators 
<=,  >=   <  , >  , !=

logical operator


HOW TO SOLVE A Problems
1  READ the problem CAREFULLY


3 WRITE THE ALGORITHM  step by step procedure each step must be simple unambiguous and finite

4 write the fake code(pseudo-code)

5 code it !

6. unit testing , cyclomatic complexity(to find number of paths in the logic),optimize the logic.
