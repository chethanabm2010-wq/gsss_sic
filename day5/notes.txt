Using problem Solving Techniques
*Read the problem
input: string

 ##  What is *args?
args stands for arguments.
* means "take any number of positional arguments and pack them into a tuple".
It lets you call a function with variable number of inputs.
Example

def add_numbers(*args):
    print(args)       # args is a tuple
    return sum(args)

print(add_numbers(1, 2))         # (1, 2) → 3
print(add_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4))   # (1, 2, 3, 4) → 10
